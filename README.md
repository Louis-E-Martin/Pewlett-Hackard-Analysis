# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overveiw
In this module we took multiple diffrent files that had diffrent data and used them to make new files that had the specfic data we want. We did this using SQL and doing filters and joins on the data to get all the data we wanted into one table. Our goal was first to find the employees that will likly retire soon and then find their job title so we could have the number of people from each job type leaving. For the second table we created we looked for younger employees that would be candidates for training.

## Results
- From the [tables](https://github.com/Louis-E-Martin/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/retiring_titles.csv) we made we can make a few conclutions. First the majority of the people leaving will be the senior emploeeys so senior staff and engineers so the most replacement will be needed there
- The other postions will also lose some people but not nearly the amount comapred to the two roles mentioned previously
- We can see who and that there are a large number of people who qualify for the metorship program
- Howerver there are vastly more people leaving then are avalible to be mentored

## Summary
As we can see there will be a large number of people entering retering age very soon. By the metrics we where using there will be 72,458 people retireing in the near future so to keep the smae number of employees a lot of hiring would need to be done. Some of the postions that are being vacated could be filled by employees currently at the company. When comparing it to the number of employees that we have that can be menored the number leaving far outstripes who can be trained so there should be no shortage of people to mentor current emploeeys. Prehaps the number of people that are elidigble for mentoring could increase adding maybe another year oif people to selct from to make the numbers match more. Another intristing thing to find would be the number of people who are in the mentor program who are currently in postions that are not senior postions and would not need the mentoring.
