# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overveiw
In this module we took multiple diffrent files that had diffrent data and used them to make new files that had the specfic data we want. We did this using SQL and doing filters and joins on the data to get all the data we wanted into one table. Our goal was first to find the employees that will likly retire soon and then find their job title so we could have the number of people from each job type leaving. For the second table we created we looked for younger employees that would be candidates for training.

## Results
- From the [tables](https://github.com/Louis-E-Martin/Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis/blob/main/retiring_titles.csv) we made we can make a few conclutions. First the majority of the people leaving will be the senior emploeeys so senior staff and engineers so the most replacement will be needed there
- The other postions will also lose some people but not nearly the amount comapred to the two roles mentioned previously
- We can see who and that there are a large number of people who qualify for the metorship program.
- Howerver there are vastly more people leaving then are avalible to be mentored
